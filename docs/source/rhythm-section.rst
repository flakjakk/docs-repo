Bass players
############

Stick with the bass-drum. If you and the drummer are not together the whole band gets loose. You are the foundation of the music, laid down so solidly that the other instruments can walk all over the place without falling over. Sounds odd but that's how it is, really.
I've heard too many 'lead' bass players in my time. If you're into experimental stuff then great, but most players want a solid foundation - so give it to them.

	Two Basic Rules :

    * RULE 1: Keep Time
    * RULE 2: Keep It Simple

You won't believe how many kit players don't follow these rules! If you cannot play a straight 4/4 for 32 bars at a time without resisting the impulse to do a blazing 5-drum/4-cymbal break in 32nth notes, and your name is not Dave Weckl or Steve Gadd, give it a miss. Listen to any Toto or Level 42 song and you'll get the picture.
