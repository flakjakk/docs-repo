Band placement on stage
-----------------------

Where the band is going to be placed is usually the last thing on the club owner / manager's mind. This means you often find yourself in an unsatisfactory situation - pre-empt this as much as possible by visiting the venue and finding the best possible place to play. You need to know how much floor area you require for a minimal setup [when you're all on stage and nobody is being side-swiped by the person next to them's guitar]. Discuss the options with the manager / owner. Given a logical argument they will usually agree with your demands.
