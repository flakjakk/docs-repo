## Lead / rhythm guitar issues

Knowing how to really play the guitar is the first step. Once you can follow a chord sheet, play the chords, and string them together in a meaningful way, you are at the bottom of the stair-case. There is a long way to go to get to the top. The target is to learn how to use the guitar in context.

For instance, you can play a standard A-E-D or C-F-G sequence in hundreds of different ways. Once you have the changes down you can start looking for contrasting ways to attack the chords. Try different sounds [if you use an electric guitar with effects], or strumming patterns, legato or staccato, make each note stand out or play them all at once, a brighter or a warmer sound / tone, open chords or play higher up the neck - so many possibilities. Which one/s you use depends entirely on context.

This breaks down into three areas of concern:
1. The sound you will use
2. Which inversions of the chords you will use, and
3. The way you will play those notes / chords

But you have to have a reason for which methods you use because merely playing along mindlessly has no point. At all.
