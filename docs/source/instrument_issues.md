## Lead / rhythm guitar issues

Knowing how to really play the guitar is the first step. Once you can follow a chord sheet, play the chords, and string them together in a meaningful way, you are at the bottom of the stair-case. There is a long way to go to get to the top. The target is to learn how to use the guitar in context.

For instance, you can play a standard A-E-D or C-F-G sequence in hundreds of different ways. Once you have the changes down you can start looking for contrasting ways to attack the chords. Try different sounds [if you use an electric guitar with effects], or strumming patterns, legato or staccato, make each note stand out or play them all at once, a brighter or a warmer sound / tone, open chords or play higher up the neck - so many possibilities. Which one/s you use depends entirely on context.

This breaks down into three areas of concern:
1. The sound you will use
2. Which inversions of the chords you will use, and
3. The way you will play those notes / chords

But you have to have a reason for which methods you use because merely playing along mindlessly has no point. At all.

### Rhythm guitar

The rhythm guitarist bridges the gap between the rhythm section and the melody, and therefore forms an integral part of any guitar-band's sound. If he cannot hack it the band will sound bad. The rhythm guitar however must keep the background moving continuously, he's constantly on the front line, and must know what he's doing if he wants to maintain credibility. Accurate chord work, tight chord changes, perfectly&nbsp;timed breaks are part of his standard repertoire - without any of which the band sound suffers.

There are good lead and good rhythm guitarists, and often a good lead player cannot hold things together from a rhythm perspective [B.B.King never plays chords!] and vice versa. One should focus on becoming well rounded in all areas.

### Lead guitar

In lead playing once you are past the basics there are two things you must do to expand your abilities :

#### Practise

This involves knowing the chords (obviously) then learning the scales relevant to those chords. If you know your Major, Minor and Pentatonic scales you are on your way, but this is only the beginning.

Practising partly involves listening to and copying those guitarists who appeal to you most, 'borrow' their riffs, learn their techniques, then spend regular practise time on your own where you can experiment with what you learn. Discover your instrument; the feel of it, the sounds you can get out of it, which combination of guitar / amp / effects / pick-ups / tone settings / plectrum / playing styles etc. work for you. Keep in mind that it's no good trying to get your sound right while using headphones or playing softly - an amp reacts totally differently when cranked up. You'll get this great sound in your room, get to the rehearsal and everything will sound just horrible - no really!

#### Playing

Take what you have learned, and through playing with other musicians (backing tracks and/or midi files are a poor substitute) and interacting with them in rehearsal and live situations you can learn how to step up to the edge, look over, close your eyes and jump.
When your time comes don't think about what you are going to play or where you're going next, live in the moment and just play. Don't get technical, and unless you want to impress propeller-heads, play from your heart.

There are some lead guitar players who want to get up there and blast away on lead all night - this does not make for good listening and will destroy a bands sound. Aggression is good, but so is finesse, and when it comes down to it remember that tasteful lead playing is mostly a case of 'less is more'.
