At the gig . . .

.. note:: Be there on time to set EVERYTHING up and test it all before the band guys start setting up.

Cabling
-------

..

	Tip: Make sure you have enough power and audio cables for everything, then add at least two spare power, speaker and audio cables.

There areas many different ways of cabling a stage setup as there are musicians, but adhering to certain rules when supplying power to amps and routing sound-signal cables from amps and mikes to the mixing desk will make this a simple task.

In most small-stage environments the signals generated by the various cables should not interfere with each other too much, but in some environments routing cables correctly can improve sound problems dramatically. This is especially true when you are using a single-phase power supply to drive your sound equipment as well as lighting.

Lighting can cause real problems with your PA sound if you are powering your light rig from the same source as your sound equipment. Where possible you should find out if the venue has more than one power phase available. Most actually have a three-phase system and you should make sure that you separate the power for lighting from the power for the sound system and backline. This obviously requires adequate cabling.

Where possible find ways to distinguish between cable types - a guitar cable has braided insulation around a plastic-coated core while speaker cables are made up of two wires - no braid. Open one of the jack covers if you are not sure. Using a speaker cable as a guitar lead will work, but your tone will definitely be way off.

Backline
--------

The term 'backline' usually refers to all the equipment the musicians use on stage. This includes the amps, monitors, drum kit, mikes, mike-stands as well as any mixers and other paraphernalia required.

From this link we can deduce the following basic requirements:
    * Power for three amps and three effect units
    * Seven mikes with stands and cables

This excludes any power required for the monitors, PA and lights.

I will use a typical configuration for our band - a drum kit, bass guitar, two lead / rhythm guitars, a lead singer, some mikes for backing vox.
	1. Guitars 1 and 2 as well as the bass player use a typical setup ie. guitar plugged through effect pedals into an amp which is miked or lined-out and the signal sent to the mixer.
	2. The kit has two mikes, one for the kick and one for overhead - not normally used.
	3. The lead singer uses a mike for vox and sometimes mouth organ.
	4. All three guitarists sing backing vox.


Kit
---

Drummer must have carpet large enough to place the entire drum kit on, but no bigger than that [unless you like the 'loungy' feel and rolled up carpets climbing the walls]! This is critical when you're expected to play on a bare floor, and can be used as a basic template around which all your back-line gear can be arranged.

Once cabling is taken care of the drummer should set up centre-stage [yes, he should].  

If playing in a corner [often happens] and the kit sound is bouncing around [messy], try to pad the area around the kit with speaker covers, guitar cases etc. Can make a huge difference.

On small stages never mike the whole kit up, mike only the kick drum and perhaps snare / hats - the vox mikes will pick up the kit and amplify it through the PA. [This presupposes you have a reasonable kit sound to start with. If you don't it might be a good idea to mike it so you can at least tweak the EQ some, but perhaps the long view is that you should look into learning something about kit sound ?! See the Kit Sound page!]

Guitars
-------

Enough guitar stands for all guitars on stage  

Backup guitars, tuners, sticks, cables, strings, mike, mike-stands, power-supplies
