Sound
*****

A broad subject, but necessary as an understanding of the challenges involved in getting good quality sound to the listeners is essential.

On Stage
########

This section addresses some of the issues with regard to:
	1. on stage sound
	2. back-line sound and
	3. front-of-house sound

Terminology
-----------
	
I use terms like muddy, wooly, fuzzy, thin, hard, warm, crunch/y, bite, edge, middy, bottom, tops etc. to describe how I 'feel' sound. If you have any questions as to the exact meaning please let me know. At some point I may have to put a glossary together that explains all this.

The first thing you need to understand is that 'everyone is a sound engineer'. And everyone hears sound differently. I have only one basic criteria for a good front-of-house sound, that is: Listeners MUST be able to hear everything that is played / sung on stage at all times. Achieving this is sometimes not that easy.
