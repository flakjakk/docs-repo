Sound
*****

A broad subject, but necessary as an understanding of the challenges involved in getting good quality sound to the listeners is essential.

On Stage
########

This section addresses some of the issues around on stage or back-line sound and front-of-house sound [anything coming off stage].

I use terms like muddy, wooly, fuzzy, thin, hard, warm, crunch/y, bite, edge, middy, bottom, tops etc. to describe how I 'feel' sound. If you have any questions as to the exact meaning please let me know. At some point I may have to put a glossary together that explains all this.

If you have 1000 sound engineers you will get 1000 different ways of getting a sound. I only have one definition for a good front-of-house sound, that is: Listeners MUST be able to hear everything that is played / sung on stage at all times. This is easier said than done.
