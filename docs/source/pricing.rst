Pricing
*******

Always ascertain the procedure for drinks beforehand, and find out if you get discount / write offs etc. Same goes for food. We always run a band tab and pay it at the end of the night. That way everyone's got money when it's time to cough up! And the worst that can happen is you pay full price for everything. The best is [on a really good night] the club owner might write the bill off completely. Now isn't that nice?  

Find out if you are required to provide background music or MC functionality - if so, depending on the parameters, you might consider re-negotiating your price.  

Never do additional sets beyond the already agreed number without negotiating an additional fee. Ever.  

Pitch the cost of the band correctly, but don't sell yourself short by dropping your price. Ever.  

Private functions always fetch a higher price - anything from 20-400% higher than club gigs! Know your client. We did a gig where we were paid 4 times the price of a whole night for only one hour on stage - and we got to spend the night in a 5 star hotel up in the mountains. They paid happily. Know your client.
